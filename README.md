### Hello everyone ðŸ‘‹

I started my IT career in 2009 supporting small companies with windows server. This job I was service desk Level 2 support analyst. From next years I specialized in different areas of modern software development.

On the present, I work as a Software Architect at Sensedia. Here my main goal is to deliver event-driven software solutions using microservices in large scale environments, with a focus on online payment companies.
